        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <pre>
                I'm Shon Shtern, a current freshman working towards a degree in Engineering Physics at the
            University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My goal is to eventually go to graduate school with a
            concentration in Condensed Matter Physics, specifically superconductors and superfluids. I love to
            take all information I learn, break it down into its most basic components, and analyze it. Also, I
            value dignity, efficiency, and honesty, resulting in me constantly putting in my best effort to
            achieve something through my work. Finally, I value teamwork because I believe that through
            cooperation and trust, anyone can achieve something phenomenal. To summarize, I am someone who loves
            doing what he's doing and is willing to learn as much as possible to improve.</pre>

        <h2> Hobbies: </h2>
        <pre>
                The largest hobby I currently have is chess. Ever since my freshman year of high school, I studied chess
            consistently through chess books, coaching, and tactics training. I also constantly go to compete in
            large tournaments. Currently, my USCF is in the 1800 range, which puts me as a Class A player.
            In other words, despite not being the best player in the world, chess is something that I genuinely
            enjoy and plan to continue doing in the future.
